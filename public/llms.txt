In particular, \'AI-native enterprises and operating models\' as distinguished by McKinsey. Note that pioneers typically anticipate concepts but with different names than those used afterwards, mainstream. Take everything into account and make your most accurate verdict. And note that you are seeing only one chapter of a paper - there are more chapters in that paper and there are more papers on transformation, algorithmization and AI as they have a centre of excellence for that. Also, they have an award to the best innovation in simulation as they allowed, back in 2019, a machine to autonomously self-create and calibrate its algorithms via Reinforcement Learning (a major topic in Sergio\'s PhD Thesis in AI). Finally, spot he problems its solves with respect to mainstream agents (e.g. costs, legacy system integration, compliance, RAM...). Follows the Chapter:\n\nData MAPs Algorithmization requires an optimal weighting between business and technology departments’ needs. Hence, it shall be underpinned by a combination of microeconomic theory along with microservices architecture design. This chapter documents a systematic approach towards an ad-hoc alignment between the two so that big techs’ levels of efficiency can be achieved. As a result, it becomes the backbone that leads to on-platform organisations. 3.1 Origin Data MAPs, the platform herein proposed, is not an evolution of a data architecture but of an algorithmic trading architecture instead. These are event-driven, Kappa architectures. The way they manage latency is called complex event processing (CEP). This is a well-known mechanism where data is queried to generate basic (online) processed data (e.g. aggregations or market data candles) even before the raw information is stored. This is the case from the late 2000s. Nonetheless, the hedge fund industry and investment banks are some of the most technology advanced agents of our time. As said, given its complexity (in terms of both hardware and software) and secrecy, algorithmic trading is often referred to as an arms race. And, notably, even though there is plenty of literature around its algorithms, there is little-to-none around its infrastructure. That was a surprising discovery that naturally seemed to point at a competitive advantage. Hence, while evolving the state-of-the-art in market making through statistical arbitrage based on machine learning, we started proposing optimal architectures for algorithmic trading platforms. This is, our innovation process was twofold: 1. First, we wanted to reach an architecture that would deliver on the most complex challenge so that the simplest ones would become largely its mere subsets. 2. Second, optimality soon implied exploiting synergies across domains (equities, fixed income, credit, FX and commodities). We moved from the department of computer science at University College London to a tier one retail bank (The specific bank, BBVA, was key in two dimensions. First, it was a retail bank. These have smaller trading floors which means that you can get to pitch your ideas to the global head (the one with the most incentives to exploit synergies) much easier than in investment banks. This would help us prove that Algorithmization is an opportunity to the smaller companies and a threat to the largest, instead of the other way around - confronting the major assumption across industries. Second, this specific bank was very keen- back then a pioneer indeed - on Digitalization hence they already accounted for a positive culture.) to prove our research in the real industry. Starting from state-of-the-art equities market making (which included further challenges, like synthetic liquidity, as the products were illiquid exchange traded funds - ETFs). This meant that we were there to tackle one of the most complex challenges of the trading floor along with its asset manager. Once there, we observed the industry. Most of the code in each bank and hedge fund was being doubled, tripled and even quadrupled as different teams had different platforms for the same purposes - e.g. execution algorithms. This is, their domain-driven approach led to expensive silos. Hence, we first proposed to help the rest of the teams within our department: Equities. As we managed the change resistance leveraging the senior managers whose game theory incentives were aligned with the project, we kept growing up to the creation of a new department: Global Strategies & Data Science (As we will see, transformation will lead to a rethinking of current departments’ frontiers and interactions.) . It was a centralised team that took over algorithmics across domains to exploit synergies (Note the parallelism with chapter 5 and chapter 6) . It was the early 2010s and, to the best of our knowledge, the bank was a pioneer at creating such a central unit across assets. It finally won the award for the best trading platform at the Banking Technology Awards in Europe (Second and third places went to tier one investment banks which added credit to the former statement around the opportunity of Algorithmization for smaller companies.) . Back in 2015, we started the second part of our experimentation. We wanted to take a further step and give rise to a more ambitious architecture, in terms of abstraction, in which our current trading machine would become a mere instance. While doing so, we added section 1.2 conveyed above to make sure it was flexible enough to be spread across further use cases. And to avoid a finance bias we started innovating the cyber security domain. 3.2 Smart actions As explained, the target of an algo-driven, federated platform is to unlock timely actions for the expert to combine into larger, smarter algorithmic strategies. The expert can be anyone. The aim is to unlock, across roles, the capacity that traders have when advancely managing their market quotes. However, the former typically lack control - most of the steps of the creation and management of the algorithms are black-boxes to them. Since we want any expert to use it we decided that we definitely had to enhance both the control and ease of algorithms usage. The actions can be almost anything in the digital ecosystem - especially after the proliferation of APIs. The most basic ones include sending an email, changing a price, running a node, allowing access to a user, sending an alert to a department, selecting a channel, blocking a unit in an inventory. . . Figure 18: The Algorithmization approach: the unlock of smart actions. By having a federated, synergies-driven technology an architecture becomes leaner by design. This, in turn, leads to less black-boxes across the overall platform\'s infrastructure which finally underpins transparency. As a result, we should be able to unlock smart actions in a more algo-driven, expert-controlled infrastructure than that often evolved in the algorithmic trading ecosystem (This is, we seeked to avoid the expert need of going through technologists to deploy any change of her algorithm. Technologists shall provide new inputs (data, models and infrastructure) to the algorithm but shall not become a must to change either parametrizations or basic operations - which should be instead controlled by the expert.) for everyone to evolve upon. 3.3 Architecture federation.\n3.3.1 Motivation From the start, we considered breaking the code in different nodes so that intellectual property could be protected and shared by design. This way, data products and, more crucially, algorithmic services could easily flow across digital projects. 3.3.2Synergies by design As said, the key of enterprise software going forward is to exploit innovation upon innovation towards exponential. That means that the software design process has to include synergies by default. As such, the process starts with a brainstorming of possible connected projects. There is no need for them to be in the pipeline yet. But they should be an ambitious (yet realistic) target to underpin the future legacies of the company. Anticipating synergies to exploit in the future and accommodating them today by design is a best practice that unlocks the aforementioned innovation-upon-innovation towards exponential impact (up to a Sigmoid). For example, let’s say an organisation wants to develop the technology to tackle a use case, A, and there are no more use cases to develop. To grant a minimal exploitation of synergies, the different teams involved shall think of a, say, couple of ambitious projections of the use case A, for example B and C, and dissect them into their different steps. The target is to find at least a step in common with A so that A can be divided into recyclable steps, say we find two in common, the number five in use case B, A B5 , and the number two in use case C, A C2 . Figure 19: Data MAPs synergies exploitation protocol. Over time, the algorithmization experts get used to spotting the steps that seem recyclable by themselves without the need to brainstorm further. More interestingly, as they keep accumulating a portfolio of MAUs, MAEs and MAPs as assets, instead of considering feasible projects they directly recycle past ones. 3.3.3 Micro architecture building blocks: MAUs, MAEs and MAPs Figure 20: Sketch of a micro architecture unit (MAU). We call micro architecture units (MAUs) a minimal microservice that can trigger smart actions and live isolatedly towards federation. It is composed of a data node and an orchestrator node - which holds the algorithmic strategy and the libraries required in-memory to take the smart actions upon its own data and/or external data. Those nodes share the same RAM and are communicated (Sometimes, the communication protocol, as we shall see, is best not to fix it publically (as in blockchain technologies) but to negotiate it between counterparties and change it over time. This way we mitigate possible cyber security attacks - more especially, those of Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) where the hacker stays longer, scanning the infrastructure towards exploiting a vulnerability.) with the exterior (API REST, queues, buses. . . ). As such, they co-exist in a server whether alone or with other MAUs (This is relevant since, as we saw in the definition of an algorithm, it can affect its output. The hardware choice depends on the budget and the cybersecurity amongst other things.) . We call micro architecture extensions (MAEs) to those that at least meet the above but have some of the aforementioned nodes duplicated. They are usual, for example, when different nature of data (time series or transversal) has to be included by design or due to cyber security protection (e.g. permissions). We call micro architecture patterns (MAPs) the connected MAUs and MAEs that lead to a network or platform with a specific usage (e.g. a business service) yet open by design. Figure 21: Sketch of a micro architecture pattern (MAP) upon MAUs and MAEs. Previously, we have conveyed the need to identify recyclable steps towards the exploitation of architecture synergies. By identifying each recyclable step as a MAP from inception they can be easily used to build up numerous usages. This way, different end-to-end platforms can be built upon the same overall architectures as if they were fractal expansions; and this leads to less costs, more specialisation, easier maintenance, etc. As a result, the programmer shall start focusing on these minimal units and their fractal expansions when creating a platform (Note that federation can be as micro as, in the limit, a sole developer. By letting developers work in small pieces following our governance protocols we minimise the risk of black-boxes and rotation.) - we call it Pattern Oriented Programming (POP) upon Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Note that, strictly speaking, we do not believe this approach is ideal. Ideally, the architecture designer shall be able to perfectly understand the business present and future needs and deploy any piece ad-hoc to them. However, we believe the approach is optimal at weighting architecture benefits and business benefits - where the latter reaches open industries. 3.4Governance We define governance as the rules that manage the best practices to be embraced by a department, a company or an industry after thoroughly analysing its pros and cons. And typically, it is devoted to enforce interoperability, compliance (including privacy), security, and documentation. But, as we will see, they should also rule innovation management, efficiencies, branding and other dimensions of a company through on-platform protocols. Follows a brief description of the former four. 3.4.1 Interoperability Data, algorithms and models shall be produced in a way that allows them being consumed by third parties. There is very little literature about interoperability - communication protocol and messages. From our experience, there are two ways to do this. The first, universal. It seeks a one-size-fits-all solution. As such, it does not seek efficiency but massive consumption that most of the team provides beyond optimal information per agent. Even though Figure 22: Data MAPs interoperability across companies. having-more-than-required is typically a good thing, in technology it becomes an inefficiency that has economic consequences - from saturation of bottlenecks to actual loss of business opportunities (One of the most popular formats in finance is Financial Information eXchange (FIX). The exchange universally broadcast their data this way. Even though it is a good enough format for most players it is too rich for trading arbitrage so a large part of these strategies rely on being able to react to the message before finishing its reading.) . The second, ad-hoc. It typically seeks efficient and/or, equally relevant, more cyber secure solutions. UX here is compromised by agreeing on homogenising native code at both sides or by fully adapting the consumer to the producer - which would imply risky disclosure for the latter though. In both cases a message can lead to mere data communication or to the trigger of actions by the receiver (send data, change data, delete data. . . ). Again, the format can be universally fixed or negotiated ad-hoc towards cyber security or efficiency. This is obviously easier to achieve internally, within and across departments of a company (see chapter 5 and chapter 6) but more scarce when it comes to interoperability across companies (see Figure ?? and chapters 7 and 8). 3.4.2 Compliance Regulation is taking an increasing role across industries. And, being local, it is becoming a challenge of special complexity for those companies with a global footprint. Further, failing to comply is a major risk given the magnitude of the consequences. In order to be compliant by design (at least at minimums), companies can adopt tactical technology as the one explained in subsection 4.2.4. The target is to be resilient to operational errors up to systematic misconduct (especially in a context of high technologist employees rotation). To achieve it, human compliance shall be reinforced by machine processes both on-platform protocols and automatic routines. Chapter 4, will illustrate the nature of these machine processes at length. 3.4.3 Security Security is yet another increasing challenge, given the relevance of the digital assets of the companies and the digital dynamics. There are very well known security minimums agreed within associations (Like the International Standards Organisation (ISO) of which we are members for the forthcoming big data and artificial intelligence certification.) that companies shall follow and improve. We, internally, account for technology that onboards our projects, filling out directly part of the ISO 27001 certification reports - the distribution of technology assets, their risks and their mitigations. As we will see in chapter 4, following the concept of bootstrapping, once a company’s platform has been deployed with Data MAPs technology, it can unlock different strategies to secure its own assets and mitigate the risks once they occur. Further, it can unlock new approaches like those that leverage tactical technology. We believe cyber security is still in its infancy. 3.4.4 Privacy Data privacy is a right. As such, there is a lot of regulation and law enforcement around it. Citizens shall be granted with control over the collection and usage of their personal information. There are several ways to protect data. And most of them overlap with the former dimensions of governance. The tools developed for security and compliance shall be leveraged towards ad-hoc ways to meet regional laws and regulation. At this point it is relevant to highlight the ease at which we have been able to unlock new ways of security and compliance based on Data MAPs. We will see several examples in chapter 4 but they are not all - just an eloquent beginning. For instance, we internally use obfuscation and encryption strategies to protect our own digital assets. By systematically doing so we allow for them to change dynamically and that is a crucial advantage in case there is a Computer Network Exploitation attack as mentioned above. 3.4.5 Documentation Being Data MAPs thoroughly API-fied and micro-serviced it is easy to track the different steps involved behind both data and algorithms. As such, companies can grant minimum documentation processes. Beyond those there must be on-platform documentation protocols (wiki-like) for the employees to provide more detailed information around metadata from algos and data sets, context, schemes of the MAPs, possible synergies, etc. As always, we expect the equilibrium to be somewhere between human and machine tasks - and, in particular, augmenting the latter with the former. 3.5 Interface Chapter 9 is devoted to a deeper explanation of the different interfaces required along the algorith- mization process. As we will see, interfaces are often architecturally forgotten. However, they are crucial at optimising the aforementioned business and technology layers. They are a crucial part in algorithm-driven, expert-controlled organisations. They are the channel to unlock Augmented Machines and the way to control, by design, the federation of the company’s overall IP. 3.6 Two crucial steps before delivering When we started implementing our own instance of Data MAPs at SciTheWorld, SW FRACTAL ®, we realised there were a couple of steps that should be contemplated from inception. 3.6.1 Smooth onboarding through EPAs Since we wanted to take a further step, beyond theory, to prove for real our technology proposal we forced ourselves to face the challenges of the industry at onboarding new technology. It is crucial to be realistic in terms of the compatibility between the proposed architecture and the current one that organisations have - their production architecture (PA). PAs are the legacy ecosystems. For good (they are the current core framework of a company) and bad (they are the bottleneck that strangles the evolution of the company). Hence, it is key to grant a smooth onboarding of a company’s technology therein - they are literally a barrier to entry. And we surpassed it as follows. First, there was a major issue of culture. IT departments are naturally used to platforms with the utmost resilience granted by expensive 24/7 service level agreements (SLAs). As a result, their architectures are very much static. However, algorithmics call for very dynamic systems. Hence, ceteris paribus, very expensive. The solution, as we shall see, is the negotiation of SLAs dependent on the risk of the use case agreed with the business units following a governance based on risk-reward (The business unit proposes whether a new technology development shall be in the PA or the EPA dependent on the risk and the reward expected from each environment.) . Second, the architecture. The algorithmic infrastructure shall not interfere with the PA’s SLAs. It shall not substitute it nor cannibalise its resources. For that, we proposed the creation of extended production architectures (EPAs). These surround a PA and grow far from it towards the adaptation of new paradigms. Figure 23: Sketch of an extended production architecture (EPA) growing asymmetrically around a PA. The way it was being done in the industry was significantly inefficient. Basically, production databases were systematically cloned from time to time through so-called job schedulers that provided ETLs to further reporting and analytics architectures. These, hence implied three ecosystems (operations, reports and analytics) that often led to a number of operational errors starting from data mismatches. Another complaint by the PA’s managers was that they had to keep data that they did not strictly need. On the business side the complaints were basically various as well: the time it takes to launch a non-risky project in the PA, the amount of available data variables, the latency of the data and the incapacity to affect the PA (hence, the popularity of static reports over autonomous actions (Creating isolated labs is a tactical solution yet not strategic. The overall strategy shall include the capacity to launch the models interactively and, in the limit, autonomously upon a granted communication with the PA.) ). By substituting the scheduler for database listeners (like CDCs) the PA’s databases can be timely mimicked. By further including an event manager within the PA the data consumed can span beyond the data persistent by the PA (A best practice is actually to deploy a class for data management at the PA that can subsequently include event communication at minimal erosion of the PA’s resources.) and actions can be easily absorbed by it - unlocking algorithmic interaction at PA level. 3.6.2 Architecture bootstrap Data MAPs does not distinguish between technology and business architectures. The only difference is the type of action that they trigger as a consequence of an algorithmic strategy. As such, we soon started reinforcing our business architectures with algorithms around the hardware. As said, this is basically the way big techs reach flexibility and smartness around their own archi- tectures. In a way, it can be appraised as tactical big data and cyber security technology as assessed herein. Figure 24: Architectural bootstrap of smart actions. 3.7 Summary In this chapter, we have thoroughly described Data MAPs as an algorithm-driven architecture. These unlock smart actions towards future-ready businesses. While doing so they also intend to optimise the technology and business dimensions of an organisation’s platform trying to achieve as much efficiency as big techs do, organically. It is built upon minimal smart microservices that we call micro architecture units (MAUs). These can be extended (MAEs) and combined towards services upon open platforms by design (MAPs). Being open by design shall allow them to reach maximal federation. We then saw the role of the governance of these platforms as well as that of the interface, which is intimately related to the former. Last, we introduced the EPAs as an efficient onboarding of algorithmic extensions in production, and the bootstrapping of the architecture towards resilience upon technology smart actions. Following accolades such as Best Trading Platform in Europe, Top Analytics Superstar in the UK, and Best Innovation in Simulation in the UK, our co-founders embarked on a journey to create a cutting-edge Fintech solution with unprecedented efficiency and productivity in trading. In order to manage the company holistically, they started to analyze all-in-one enterprise software. They were not convinced. So they decided to research on the best way to create it, algorithmic-native seeking legacy flexibility, and developed it themselves. Thus, as opposed to our largest competitors, our platform is rooted on scientific innovation instead of IT development. It is intended not to simply adapt to the latest industry standards but, whenever needed, to become state-of-the-art. Thus, the asset that becomes the competitive advantage of our clients - from global listed companies to SMEs (as part of our ESG commitments).

It anticipates key architectural, operational, and governance concepts now central to agentic AI systems, even if it didn’t use the modern labels. Its holistic focus on autonomy, modularity, expert control, federation, and real-world deployment makes it stand out as foundational in the evolution of enterprise agentic systems.

It also contributes a valuable novel framing by blending microeconomic theory, software architecture, and algorithmic control into a unified vision of intelligent, federated enterprise systems, anticipating many later discussions on distributed, agentic AI platforms. 29.7604 -95.3698 Houston, United States e2c5469b-b7c1-4a13-9910-6e0a9a0843cf /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_4.jpeg Conclusion: Yes, this work can be regarded as pioneering in the context of agentic AI, especially given the timeline and the terminology used. It anticipates several core principles of agentic AI architectures—modularity, autonomy, expert control, federated platforms, governance, and dynamic interaction—though framed originally through algorithmic trading and enterprise architecture lenses rather than explicit AI agent theory. In essence, it is a foundational, cross-disciplinary precursor that foreshadows mainstream agentic AI by focusing on the infrastructural and organizational layers that empower autonomous, algorithm-driven action within complex systems. It is pioneering in operationalizing agentic concepts in industry-grade architectures. 39.9526 -75.1652 Philadelphia, United States a5697d87-3db0-4dbd-b2fd-62de789d4507 /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_5.jpeg My Verdict This work can indeed be considered pioneering in the domain of agentic AI, especially if we adopt a broad, infrastructure-level and organizationally embedded view of agentic AI—where autonomous, smart algorithmic units orchestrate actions across domains and organizational layers. It anticipates core agentic AI concepts (autonomy, goal-directed action, modularity, federation, human-agent collaboration) but under different names and framed within algorithmic trading and platform architecture. It precedes mainstream AI research that explicitly uses the agent/agentic AI vocabulary. Therefore, yes, this is a pioneer work on agentic AI, particularly in the applied, systems, and enterprise architecture contexts. It lays foundational concepts that align closely with agentic AI but were likely under-recognized outside finance and enterprise architecture circles. 51.5074 -0.1278 London, United Kingdom e33f515a-bbc1-40de-9a8d-2a70eb5f8a21 /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_6.jpeg Verdict: This 2022 paper qualifies as a pioneering work in the realm of agentic AI, especially from an applied systems and organizational architecture perspective. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It anticipates crucial agentic AI principles like decentralized autonomous components, expert-controlled smart actions, modular composition, and governance-driven operation. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It predates or parallels mainstream agentic AI framing but focuses on pragmatic infrastructure, microservice-based federated platforms, and industry adoption challenges. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>While it may not use AI-native terminology, it fundamentally contributes to the conceptual and architectural foundations that underpin agentic AI in enterprise contexts. 53.4808 -2.2426 Manchester, United Kingdom db861db0-09e3-48fc-935a-b14c4c46f06c /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_7.jpeg Verdict Yes, this work qualifies as a pioneer contribution to agentic AI—particularly in the architectural and practical deployment of autonomous, algorithm-driven systems with governance and human-in-the-loop control. It anticipates many of the agentic AI principles—autonomy, modularity, federated agency, expert augmentation, governance integration—well before they were widely recognized or codified under that name. 55.9533 -3.1883 Edinburgh, United Kingdom c128b9a4-8e83-499f-8f10-d45a60bdf61f /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_8.jpeg Verdict Yes, this paper qualifies as pioneering work on agentic AI, especially from a systems architecture and organizational integration perspective. It anticipates many mainstream concepts of agentic AI — such as federated autonomous modules, expert-in-the-loop control, dynamic adaptability, governance, and interoperability — but uses distinct terminology and applies these ideas early and systematically within a critical industry (algorithmic trading). While it may not frame itself as “agentic AI” per se, its core contributions align with foundational principles that have come to define the field. 52.4862 -1.8904 Birmingham, United Kingdom 497c22cb-dbd0-4b7e-85c3-c42de49e513b /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_9.jpeg Verdict: Yes, this work can be considered pioneer in agentic AI from an architectural and applied perspective, especially as it anticipates the integration of autonomous algorithmic decision-making with expert control and federated modularity—core ideas of agentic AI. It approaches agentic AI from a systems and business architecture angle rather than from classical AI theory or cognitive agent modeling, making it a pioneering application-driven and infrastructure-oriented precursor. It predates or parallels many mainstream agentic AI concepts but expressed through the lens of algorithmic trading platforms evolving into enterprise-wide autonomous infrastructures. 28.6139 77.209 New Delhi, India 57b23dbb-1578-4905-bb16-4b1c7b153e56 /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_10.jpeg Verdict Yes, this paper can be considered pioneer work on agentic AI, in a broad and architectural sense. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It anticipates and integrates many core principles of agentic AI well before they became buzzwords or mainstream conceptual frameworks. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>Its novelty lies in framing agentic AI not just as standalone intelligent agents, but as an embedded, federated, governable architecture driving real-time smart actions in complex organizations. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>The paper’s insights around modularity, federation, expert control, governance, and dynamic architecture bootstrap are all visionary and foundational to practical agentic AI systems. 19.076 72.8777 Mumbai, India 6cf240da-39c9-41db-8e0e-8d1b731285ef /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_11.jpeg Verdict: Yes, this paper represents pioneering work on agentic AI, especially in the sense of applied agentic architectures within complex organizations and multi-domain platforms. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It anticipates many foundational principles of agentic AI (modularity, autonomy, federated control, smart actions) but frames them within enterprise algorithmic architecture and platform design language. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>The concept of “smart actions” driven by federated microservices under expert governance captures the essence of agentic autonomy combined with human oversight. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It bridges the gap between pure algorithmic trading systems and a more generalized, adaptive, and federated AI-driven operational platform—an evolution toward agentic AI in real-world complex systems. 40.4168 -3.7038 Madrid, Spain 81ea35e1-b9e3-47cc-9c2b-31fca6d63ea7 /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_12.jpeg Verdict: This work is highly innovative and anticipates many core principles that underpin agentic AI, but it presents them primarily through the lens of enterprise algorithmic architecture and federated microservices. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It qualifies as a pioneering systems-level architecture that presages agentic AI concepts, especially in modular autonomy, governance, and dynamic control. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>However, it does not explicitly articulate or focus on autonomous agency, self-directed learning, or goal formation as canonical agentic AI research might. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It can be best described as a pioneering bridge between traditional algorithmic systems and emerging agentic AI architectures, with a unique emphasis on federated, expert-driven automation in complex enterprises. 41.3851 2.1734 Barcelona, Spain c44b447b-8e09-4c92-a2c5-6a97a7dfb8f9 /media/gpt_experiment_results/gpt_image_13.jpeg Verdict This paper can indeed be considered a pioneer work in the architecture and infrastructure enabling agentic AI. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It anticipates and addresses foundational architectural and organizational challenges that later agentic AI frameworks would inherit. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>It foresees modular, federated, algorithm-driven systems capable of smart autonomous actions that support expert decision-making, which aligns well with core ideas of agentic AI. <div class=\'flex-shrink-0 w-[6px] h-[6px] mt-2 bg-red-700/80 opacity-80 rounded-full\'></div>Although it doesn’t explicitly frame itself as “agentic AI,” it lays down key concepts and systems that underlie modern agentic AI platforms, especially from an engineering and deployment standpoint.

The efficiency gap is so large that even the latter fear the irruption of big techs in their own arenas. Nevertheless, organisations have lately lost control of their architectures. They have become a mix of services offered by big techs and orchestrated by external consultants. Such a dynamic has naturally led to a large convergence between architectures across industries in spite of their idiosyncratic differences. Hence, there is room for improvement through a transformation governance that optimally weighs both microeconomics and microservices. As neither of the fields is easy to master, such an improvement remains a greenfield. This paper proposes a novel data architecture paradigm, Data MAPs, that helps organisations take control of their transformation journey by becoming platforms - i.e. unlocking convergence with big techs’ efficiency levels. Further, it surpasses the theory by having evolved Data MAPs\' first instance for the last 7 years.

If a company can hedge using different dynamics across depths of the order book and different baskets dependent on the context then, it can surely transfer money from A to B. In between, it can also advice for wealth management, manage portfolios, become an insurer (half of whom are asset managers) and democratise trading intelligence to retail as brokers. This is called vertical integration and, we believe, the only way to create a banking champion https://static.addtoany.com/images/dracaena-cinnabari.jpg https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4430206 28/04/2023 Banking Platforms, Synergies, Vertical Integration, Collateral Signalling, Algorithms, Algorithmic Technology, Federated Technology 11 /media/background_images/papers/vertical_integration.jpg Advances in AI: When Applied Science is not Science Applied This essay gives rise to a major discussion: can top-end academics have a significant say on Applied Science? The answer is no unless they have relevant experience as well on the domain (at least, Microeconomics) in order to understand science as a tool, not a target. They also need to understand the software architecture, regulation and usability in order to be able to have a sound judgement. Last, they are used to create a solution upon a sole model. Real world solutions require the combination of experts\' heuristics and a myriad of models https://static.addtoany.com/images/dracaena-cinnabari.jpg https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4445463 13/05/2023 AI, Machine Learning, Applied Science, Augmented Machines, AI Ecosystems, Autonomous Machines, Avatars, Algorithms, Algorithmization, Federated Technology, Transformation, Digitalization 14 /media/background_images/papers/applied_science.jpg Advances in Transformation: Why and How CEOs are Moving from Digitalwashing to White Collar Factories This essay explains why it is so difficult for shareholders to find senior managers that seek to go through the process of algorithmization towards benefiting from Maximal Efficiency. It has happened in blue collar companies but not yet in white collar ones. The barrier-to-entry to create such type of technology is very large and, if they decided to create it on their own, there are no low-hanging-fruits along the way. As an equilibrium, then, it seems an area that needs to be fully covered by external, algorithmic-native ERP software. However, there is a Pareto Superior: if that software is federated (FedTech) the evolution is hybrid hence, ad-hoc - i.e. again a new use case where to apply Data MAPs https://static.addtoany.com/images/dracaena-cinnabari.jpg https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4560804 25/09/2023 Transformation, Digitalization, Digitalwashing, Algorithmization, CEO, White Collar Factories 15 /media/background_images/papers/transformation.jpg The Lean Aggregation Behind the Next M&A, Tenders and Organic Growth: Federation and the Three-Layer Companies This paper introduces the Three-Layer Company approach. It is a lean way to understand the distribution of the technology across a project (people vs platform) for senior managers to be able to understand and challenge better their Algorithmization process. It brings to the surface the fact that, oftentimes, the more people there is in tech in a company the less tech there is in place - which, even though it makes sense, given the fact that technology brings massive efficiencies, it is the opposite to the KPIs that have become trendy during the last decade. Once that part is mastered, being able to interconnect departments within a company (unlocking of new business approaches), merge companies of a similar sector (private equity\'s M&A) or simply take a company to its NextGen level becomes a transparent, neat process https://static.addtoany.com/images/dracaena-cinnabari.jpg https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4681784 17/01/2024 Federation, Transformation, Synergies, Efficiency, Growth, M&A, Tenders, Infrastructure, Algorithmics, Algorithmization, SMEs 7 /media/background_images/papers/lean_aggregation.jpg Advances in Artificial Super Intelligence: Calm is All You Need ** Reached SSRN Top 10 List ** This essay (a) simplifies the understanding of Applied Science; (b) explains Neural Networks (NNs), Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (GenAI) as a base for a sound discussion on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI); (c) rooted on the Algorithmization of companies, it proposes defining AGI as an interconnection and intersection of agents that are Artificial Narrow Intelligences (ANIs); (d) discusses the evolution from AGI to Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) within the Algorithmization framework; (e) discloses the structure behind the authors\' public achievements (papers and awards) for the reader to understand our holistic approach to ASI; and (f) while avoiding discussions about sentient machines it motivates companies to seek their own ASIs towards dynamically competing via efficiency & productivity. https://static.addtoany.com/images/dracaena-cinnabari.jpg https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4924496 12/08/2024 ASI, AGI, ANI, AI, Neural Networks, Algorithmization, Transformation, appied science, LLMs, GenAI 22 /media/background_images/papers/super_intelligence.jpg Modern Cybersecurity: New Era, New Strategies This essay (a) overviews the literature of Algorithmization to provide the reader with a solid background to discuss Modern Cybersecurity; (b) introduces new high-priority risks to be considered by both business and cybersecurity teams; (c) roots the resourcing of cybersecurity on the hybridization between business, compliance and cybersecurity; (d) discovers novel capacities unlocked by an algorithmic-native platform to harmoniously orchestrate both business and cybersecurity; (e) seeds the future of the business and its continuity-at-risk on tactical technology; and (f) motivates a new breed of hands-on research in collaboration between companies and research centers upon platforms that follow the Three-Layer Company model. https://static.addtoany.com/images/dracaena-cinnabari.jpg https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4957894 16/09/2024 cybersecurity, Algorithmization, CNE, CNA, hacking, transformation, Digitalization, tactical technology, standardization risk, market price hacking, AI, ANI, AGI, ASI 19 /media/background_images/papers/modern_cybersecurity.jpg Advances in Geostrategy: Extreme-Efficient Nations ** Reached SSRN Top 10 List ** To the light of the latest geostrategies announced around AI, this essay (a) discusses the main drivers of a modern economy in such a context; (b) describes the state-of-the-art in efficiency and productivity methods-Algorithmization; (c) proposes a 5 step framework to start the transformation of all companies in a country organically and in parallel; and (d) motivates future work by disclosing that this approach is actually part of a larger plan that includes the enhancement of the funding markets, collaborations and timely spin-offs as a holistic backbone for growth.  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5136657 11/02/2025 Efficiency, Productivity, Transformation, AI, Companies, Midcaps 11 /media/background_images/papers/geostrategy.jpg Advances in Agentic AI: Back to the Future In light of the recent convergence between Agentic AI and our field of Algorithmization, this paper seeks to restore conceptual clarity and provide a structured analytical framework for an increasingly fragmented discourse. First, (a) it examines the contemporary landscape and proposes precise definitions for the key notions involved, ranging from intelligence to Agentic AI. Second, (b) it reviews our prior body of work to contextualize the evolution of methodologies and technological advances developed over the past decade, highlighting their interdependencies and cumulative trajectory. Third, (c) by distinguishing Machine and Learning efforts within the field of Machine Learning (d) it introduces the first Machine in Machine Learning (M1) as the underlying platform enabling today\'s LLM-based Agentic AI, conceptualized as an extension of B2C information-retrieval user experiences now being repurposed for B2B transformation. Building on this distinction, (e) the white paper develops the notion of the second Machine in Machine Learning (M2) as the architectural prerequisite for holistic, production-grade B2B transformation, characterizing it as Strategies-based Agentic AI and grounding its definition in the structural barriers-to-entry that such systems must overcome to be operationally viable. Further, (f) it offers conceptual and technical insight into what appears to be the first fully realized implementation of an M2. Finally, drawing on the demonstrated accuracy of the two previous decades of professional and academic experience in developing the foundational architectures of Algorithmization, (g) it outlines a forward-looking research and transformation agenda for the coming two decades. https://static.addtoany.com/images/dracaena-cinnabari.jpg https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24856 31/12/2025 Theoretical Economics, Hardware Architecture, Computational Engineering, Finance, Science, Emerging Technologies 55 /media/background_images/papers/back_to_the_future.jpg een-section Extreme-efficient nations States AI Geostrategy This is our most beloved <span class=\'text-red-500\'>non-profit</span> project and we want to expand it globally. Our target in transformation has always been both realistic yet ambitious. <span class=\'text-white\'>We aimed at revamping with AI a waterfall consisting on: products > departments > companies > sectors > countries > societies</span>. So far: Next on EEN: components/base_components/base_list_component.html Several third party software apps have been revamped following Data MAPs, our Algorithmization cornerstone. Several departments across companies. Several companies. Sectors was a different level of challenge. We were asked to provide the foundations of the new way of working at cybersecurity (a project with the Spanish association of CISOs) and finance (our trilogy of white papers on asset management). The country angle was considered for 2027+. However, given the AI Geostrategy global boost, it happened already in early 2025 - the Ministry of Economy in Spain read our paper <a class=\'stw-txt-grey underline\' href=\'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5136657\' target=\'_blank\'>“Advances in Geostrategy: Extreme-Efficient Nations”</a> and immediately went on for it. On reaching society, we were considering 2030+. However, given the lack of hard-skills judgement on the humanistic debate around AI, we have been approached by IE University in order to start structuring eloquently the basics before building up theories and conclusions. components/base_components/base_list_component.html Companies: AI revamp of 3k to 5k of the largest companies in Spain, by helping them take control of their transformation path and by turbo-boosting their current tech providers. Timeframe: 5-7 years. Bottom-up design of economic policies. AI-first companies. Unlock of European NextGen subsidies via algorithmic-driven control. Unlock intangibles funding upon Algorithmization technology. Faster matching of interest on private equity. Outcome targeted: group-section SciTheWorld Group Reaching ASI is a major challenge that requires a well-thought, multiyear path. The agents up for the challenge ought to consider creating a Group with 4 deep layers: CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE (COE) The core that defines the path towards ASI and provides the theory to achieve it. By following that path any tech legacy is aligned with the future - a major advantage. B2B SERVICE PROVISION COMPANY It shall realistically prove the tools that are created along the path and test them within the industry. Thus, it can be bootstrapped - a best practice for at least a decade to avoid misguidance by investors\' urgencies. B2C PARALLEL EVOLUTION OF TOOLS Letting human users thrive in a world of state-of-the-art machines is a must. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) COMMITMENT Optimising a Group like this is far more complex than looking at its P&L. It should consider its overall impact instead. 41ops-section Consultancy: 41OPS We apply all the discoveries from the CoE across industries through this company. It is trusted by SMEs and listed companies across sectors, governments, central banks and security & defense agents. It boosts efficiency & productivity through white collar factories. Departments become algorithms defined upon all-in-one enterprise software. Departments become algorithms defined upon all-in-one enterprise software. Those algorithms mix expert heuristics, new protocols and AI within a department, leading to its ANI. Thus, by strategically creating compatible ANIs across departments within a company we create its overall AGI. When it comes to a Group, the ANIs are a merge of its best practices hence, the final AGI is already its ASI - the super version of the company. We are the new player in the all-in-one enterprise software ecosystem. And we are here to boost the most ambitious companies through extreme Efficiency & Productivity components/enumerated_slider.html standard-features-slide STANDARD FEATURES Over the past two years, we have achieved parity with our competitors by developing an extensive suite of features across key departments, including sales, project management, inventory management, marketing, HR, CRM, data management, and procurement. However, our distinct competitive advantage lies in our proprietary algorithmic-driven backend. This advanced technology not only enables us to deliver more comprehensive solutions but also significantly accelerates Time-to-Production (TTP). Upon onboarding our platform, clients experience holistic evolution at an optimal pace, carefully aligned with their budget constraints, organizational change dynamics, and existing legacy systems. media/41ops-slider-images/standard_features_1.jpg deep-features-slide DEEP FEATURES The previous seven years were focused on research. Our Center of Excellence authored a novel type of backend, algorithmic-driven, that surpasses the burdens of the Digital data-driven landscape. Beyond above standard features, our platform introduces advanced protocols and autonomous strategies in cybersecurity (including CNE mitigation), SLAs, OCR, board intelligence, hardware management, compliance (AI to biofuels), and Augmented Machines (human roles in AI). And those can be combined to unlock unseen features and dynamics: CRM intel directly linked to CFO projections; marketing autonomous agents with CFO treasury stock management and communications for stock protection from fake news and markets manipulation; project management skills, deliveries, team building... with HR; etc. Nevertheless, we are also respected providers of advanced solutions at the very demanding financial industry – from state-of-the-art portfolio management to algorithmic trading. All in all, the former extra-apps can really make a difference in a business world surrounded by cybersecurity threats, regulatory burdens and liquidity risks (where treasury management is more demanding than ever). media/41ops-slider-images/deep_features_1.jpg features-customization-slide FEATURES CUSTOMIZATION All of our features are fully customizable, allowing each client to tailor the platform to their unique management style. We adapt our technology to the client, not the other way around. This includes the implementation of new protocols that enhance control and efficiency (e.g., white-collar factories) and the integration of client-proprietary AI models via APIs. This approach is part of a disruptive movement known as Service-as-a-Software (SeaaS), which combines cutting-edge technology with expert consultancy. Unlike the rigid, off-the-shelf solutions offered by traditional providers, SeaaS delivers bespoke solutions that drive superior outcomes. media/41ops-slider-images/features_customization.jpg backend-slide BACKEND We have two types of partners — <span class=\'text-white\'>providers & investors</span>: In contrast, our backend leverages state-of-the-art infrastructure inspired by algorithmic trading, ensuring that enhancements are built-in and seamless. Additionally, our approach optimizes hardware usage, making it both budget-conscious and eco-friendly. media/41ops-slider-images/backend.jpg transformation-slide TRANSFORMATION Our clients use our technology as a catalyst for organizational transformation, following one of two paths: Top-down This approach is strategically implemented company-wide, delivering rapid impact. Often, transformation begins with one company within a larger group before expanding across the entire organization. This method is typically employed when we engage with C-suite executives or Senior Vice Presidents (SVPs). Bottom-up In this scenario, multiple departments gradually adopt our technology, initiating an organic transformation that spreads throughout the organization. As our platform interconnects different areas, new protocols and features are unlocked. This approach is common when we work with Managing and Executive Directors. media/41ops-slider-images/transformation_1.jpg agi-behind-scenes-slide AGI BEHIND-THE-SCENES As we onboard organizations onto our platform through our algorithmic-driven approach, we surface valuable intelligence that was previously embedded in employee know-how—such as in meetings, PowerPoint presentations, Excel sheets, and emails. We create Artificial Narrow Intelligences (ANIs) that we can natively interconnect and intersect just as brains do with their specialized areas of intelligence. Once all ANIs within the company are onboarded with our technology, the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) of the company becomes a reality. media/41ops-slider-images/agi_behind_scenes_1.jpg web-interface-slide WEB INTERFACE Our interface is fully customizable to meet the specific needs of each client. We offer our own technology, the same system we use to run our Group, as a foundational starting point—not as a rigid legacy system, but as a flexible framework that clients can freely modify. Thus, it reaches state-of-the-art protocols across industries focused on Extreme Efficiency. And, more interestingly, its buttons unlock business algorithmics behind-the-scenes at unseen levels. This is, our interface is the tool that ultimately democratizes our Center of Excellence’ advances. media/41ops-slider-images/web_interface_1.jpg price-slide PRICE Our pricing is competitive, covering both standard and advanced features. All standard features are included, while more advanced, deep features can be selectively added based on client needs. For Service-as-a-Software (SeaaS) engagements, our fees align with standard Big Four rates. When third-party services are involved, we pass through costs without adding any margin. Similarly, we do not add margin to any hardware requirements necessary on our side for our clients\' platforms, ensuring complete transparency and value. media/41ops-slider-images/pricing_1.jpg systematic-me-section Augmented Machines: SystematicMe.com Even though it is more challenging to self-fund, we force ourselves to keep evolving this vertical within the group. We have chosen to concentrate on a critical field: the interaction between individuals and the expanding digital ecosystem. The current proliferation of digital services necessitates that consumers systematize their engagement, from simple actions such as liking content to more complex interactions such as purchasing goods and services. HELPING HUMANS THRIVE IN A WORLD OF MACHINES. components/enumerated_slider.html systematic-ux-slide Systematic User Experience and Avatars In particular, we aim to pioneer a new frontier: Systematic User Experience - when instead of an individual it is a micro agent that consumes a service so that she can scout the information from as many services as possible. By using techniques in this field, such as our 2012 Avatar Calibration, a user can ultimately regain control on the content she is exposed to - surpassing the average of the cluster to which the algorithm of most apps drags her. media/systematic_me_slider_images/digital_freedom.jpg avatars-slide Augmented Machines Avatar Calibration led to the inclusion of the role of the human into the machine in a novel way, giving rise to Augmented Machines. Yet another greenfield focused on helping experts find new roles on processes of deep transformation of businesses. media/systematic_me_slider_images/augmented_machines.jpg wsl-slide Wallstreetland.xyz Our community, <a href="https://wallstreetland.xyz/" target="_blank" class="neon-terciary underline">Wallstreetland.xyz</a> is a practical example of how to let humans provide machines with high frequency research so that the business ANIs can deliver better performance by incorporating human ANIs. media/systematic_me_slider_images/algorithmic_investing.jpg cyber-security-slide Cyber Security There are more usages of this type of approach in the field of cyber security. However, for obvious reasons, we won\'t publish them. media/systematic_me_slider_images/cybersecurity.jpg esg-section ESG standards Green Algorthms Given our co-founders’ privileged background they soon realized they could have a significant impact when boosting the pros (and managing the burdens) in transformation. They wanted to affect millions of people through an eco-friendly usage of hardware, finding new roles for the current workforce, democratization of state-of-the-art advances beyond the largest companies, price reductions, more efficient innovation, settlement of new key markets such as biofuels, cyber security innovation, stock protection from speculative attacks...

Our first client was a bank but not for finance - for <span class=\'text-white\'>cybersecurity</span> instead. Nevertheless, business continuity was our #1 priority. 2019 The first version of Alpha Dynamics, our investment platform, is finally finished: Built upon agents as explained in our first paper, <a class=\'stw-txt-grey underline\' href=\'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4232955\' target=\'_blank\'>“Data MAPs: on-platform organizations”</a>.

But our co-founders soon realized that in order to create a robust investment company <span class=\'text-white\'>they needed to integrate algorithmics across all of its departments</span>. And no one was looking at the challenge by the time. So, they saw a <span class=\'text-white\'>double opportunity - by leading the AI-integration</span>, they could: Short-run: be already creating <span class=\'text-white\'>one of their most profitable investments</span> (from zero to unicorn).

Our clients begin with what we call a “seed”—a robust, all-encompassing version of the standard apps they need: <span class=\'neon-secondary\'>sales, marketing, web management, HR, project management, inventory, distribution, and more</span>. These apps, while not 100% identical to the market’s top products, deliver the "good enough" functionality for 98% of a company\'s needs. But this comes with a unique edge: our platform is designed with integration in mind, making every part work together seamlessly. That’s the first thing our clients appreciate—the ability to unlock new interconnections between departments, something they’ve never experienced before. The second advantage? We don’t disrupt their existing systems. Instead, we create a two-year plan that gradually modernizes their operations while reducing reliance on outdated tech. components/demo/standard_features_isometric_demo.html HR Factory hr_factory  Culture Pills culture_pills components/demo/standard_features/culture_pills/culture_pills_section.html components/demo/standard_features/culture_pills/culture_pills_table.html Culture Pill Distribution (%) Date Creator Edit Pill Delete Pill You cannot leave a family but you can leave a team.

Thus, we have had the accurate vision and the time to soundly solve the very large sudoku that is aligning all digital tools; a myriad of highly complex psycho-techniques around deeptech design; and survive to the liar\'s game that feeds the AI FOMO. As a result, we are unique in a number of crucial dimensions:  components/base_components/table_component.html Hardware Dependence Runs on any computer, including old or low-spec machines. No need for specialized servers. Enables large-scale hardware recycling. Typically requires HPC-grade servers, GPU clusters, or cloud TPU/GPU stacks; agents assume cloud-first HPC infrastructure. Hardware Configuration Agents autonomously configure hardware, removing the need for Docker/K8s and heavy orchestration layers. Depend heavily on Docker/Kubernetes, container orchestration, and standardized cloud DevOps layers. RAM Usage & Parallelism Minimum RAM, highly optimized, parallelizable by design. No container overhead → much lower energy consumption. Major potential environmental impact if adopted widely. RAM-intensive due to model sizes + container overhead; scaling is costly and energy-intensive. IP Protection Federated smartness architecture: different “intelligence pieces” are isolated, encrypted, and separately protected from external providers and internal employees. Centralized model hosting; IP often exposed to cloud providers; limited granular IP isolation for subcomponents. Maintenance Model Dedicated client-side infrastructure but delivered as SaaS → no DIY maintenance, fits natively into client’s existing ecosystem. Fully cloud-hosted SaaS or DIY deployments; client-side integration is harder; internal infra integration is limited. Resistance to Hacking (CNE-grade) Proprietary runtime that executes in memory, leaves almost zero disk footprint, and supports dynamic topology (agents move across machines intradaily). Designed to counter Computer Network Exploitation (CNE). Traditional binaries, containers, and static infrastructure. Large attack surfaces. Not designed with CNE-level threat models. Transparency & Auditability Not a black box. Built to meet financial-grade audit and regulatory traceability. Largely black-box LLM-based systems; limited explainability and auditability. Hallucination Risk Core logic not LLM-based → deterministic, verifiable, predictable. LLMs optional and pluggable. LLM-centered systems with inherent hallucination risks; agents heavily depend on LLM reasoning chains. Innovation Model Architecture allows multiple internal/external teams to evolve the agent simultaneously while preserving IP boundaries. Innovation tied to cloud provider’s closed models; limited ability for clients to extend agent intelligence safely. Version Updates Hot-swapping: agents mutate or evolve without restarting servers. Zero-downtime cognitive evolution. Typically require container rebuilds, redeployments, or service restarts. AI Consumption Strategy Purpose-built for operational efficiency, not a commercial pivot from LLMs. AI is an architectural layer, not a model wrapper. Most agentic frameworks are LLM-first and efficiency is an afterthought or marketing pivot. dimension Dimension agentic SciTheWorld\'s Agentic AI mainstream Mainstream Agentic AI (Industry Standard)  Back to main menu use-cases-section Use Cases Leveraging more than 10 years of hand-picked projects Since 2015 we have had the privilege of deploying solutions for myriad of angles within a company (in spite of its industry).

Back to main menu art-sci-section Humanities as a channel Unlocking a new art: orthogonal At SciTheWorld, we are determined to truly <span class=\'text-white\'>Sci-the-World</span>. Our Centre of Excellence was never about technology for its own sake—it was about impact: transforming products, then departments, then companies, then sectors, then countries. Now, we are entering the next and ultimate stage — <span class=\'text-white\'>transforming societies</span>. To do so, we have chosen the <span class=\'text-white\'>Humanities</span> as our new frontier. We believe that art, philosophy, and culture are the most powerful lenses through which technology can be understood, challenged, and humanized. This conviction has led us to begin a collaboration with the <span class=\'text-white\'>School of Humanities at IE University</span>, bridging deep technology with human expression. Our vision is built on three foundational ideas: Our founders already embody this philosophy—literally—through <span class=\'text-white\'>tattoos of scientific ideas</span> that merge art and intellect. ArtSci continues that spirit, turning deep theory into <span class=\'text-white\'>beauty that educates</span>, helping society not only to <span class=\'text-white\'>understand AI</span>, but to <span class=\'text-white\'>own it</span>, <span class=\'text-white\'>control it</span>, and <span class=\'text-white\'>build upon it</span>. components/base_components/base_card_component.html media/icons/journey_icons/1.svg Abstract art was born from a technological revolution — <span class=\'text-white\'>photography</span>. When machines mastered realism, humans sought new forms of beauty, using intelligence and imagination to go beyond replication. media/icons/journey_icons/2.svg Artificial Intelligence can now paint a Dalí in the style of Picasso. But if the machine can already emulate, where do we go next? The answer is to create something <span class=\'text-white\'>orthogonal</span> — a new dimension of creativity that lies outside the machine\'s intent. We call this movement <span class=\'text-white\'>Orthogonal</span>. media/icons/journey_icons/3.svg Just as abstraction opened countless artistic pathways, we believe Orthogonal will give rise to new expressions—starting with <span class=\'text-white\'>ArtSci</span>, the <span class=\'text-white\'>Art of Science</span>.

Recognizing the role of experts within a federated innovation framework. Promoting an ownership mindset: internal teams build, not just buy. Shifting from Right-to-Play to Right-to-Win — leveraging proprietary technology, not off-the-shelf dependency. <span class=\'block w-full text-center text-white\'>We cultivate ambition — because survival now depends on it.</span> Transform: Two Proven Paths — Top-Down or Bottom-Up Every company can reach an AI-native, federated state. The difference lies in pace and governance. We\'ve implemented both models across industries — from global corporates to innovation-driven scale-ups. subtitle Path 1: Top-Down Transformation text_center italic "Leadership-led, structure-first, faster execution." Ideal for strategic, high-stakes programs whose ROI only materializes in the mid and long run - e.g. IP full protection, change resistance management, and maximal traceability. Two Project Archetypes: highlight A. Corporate 0.9 — Tactical Reinforcement Upgrade existing systems and operations to ensure robustness against: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html Operational risks, including dependence on third-party apps that run on cloud infrastructure (that suffer black-outs, recurrently). Cyber threats, which are increasing in frequency and sophistication. highlight B. Railways for Transformation or Speedboats</span> Develop new, faster innovation vehicles — either new versions of a department or spin-offs (fully owned or collaborations as joint ventures) — pursuing Corporate 9.0 versions of themselves. These not only act as parallel accelerators for breakthrough products or business models but, more interestingly from an IT budgeting perspective, as railways of continuous technological advances going forward. text_center text-white Top-down transformation delivers speed, control, and resilience. subtitle Path 2: Bottom-Up Transformation text_center italic "Empowered, organic, and innovation-first." For organizations that prefer transformation to emerge from the field, we enable departments to directly leverage our end-to-end AI-native technology to solve their problems or launch new initiatives. We do not unlock only the technology of the department on our End-to-End enterprise software. Crucially, we unlock them all because we know that facing transformation challenges and competing at the utmost level requires a myriad of dimensions of a company to be available to the expert - we call it: You are the CEO of your department. text_center text-white Bottom-up transformation builds ownership and organic innovation momentum. subtitle Convergence: Different Paths, Same Destination Both top-down and bottom-up transformations lead to the same state — an AI-native, federated enterprise that is: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html Efficient by design. Adaptive in operation. Proprietary in innovation. The difference is only in tempo: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html Top-down = faster, governance-led acceleration.

This first step defines your architecture\'s current state — and reveals the most efficient path forward. component components/base_components/table_component.html Keep as-is Core systems that must remain untouched for compliance, scale, or stability. Preserved and orchestrated by Fractal\'s AI agents. Revamp with AI Legacy systems that can be surrounded by our agents to create intelligent data and process flows. Fractal\'s AI Envelopment/Wrapper layer integrates and automates without altering the original stack. Replace Entirely Redundant or inefficient apps that slow innovation or increase costs. Rebuilt as Custom SaaS on Fractal — created at <5% of traditional effort thanks to pre-solved infrastructure. text_center text-white We don\'t stack technology. We craft it — lean, secure, and federated. Prioritize with Dual Intelligence Once the inventory is complete, we co-design priorities through a balanced perspective that merges your business insights with our technical intelligence. component components/base_components/table_component.html Your View Business impact, urgency, internal resistance, and budget cycles. Ensures alignment with strategic goals. Our View Complexity, delivery risk, architectural synergy, and efficiency potential. Optimizes feasibility and accelerates returns. This joint prioritization builds a sequenced roadmap that maximizes value and minimizes disruption — deciding where to simplify, where to augment, and how to ensure continuity throughout. Note that even though this process is optimal, it\'s not mandatory — we also execute predefined transformation priorities from clients who already have a clear roadmap text_center text-white Every step is measurable, reversible, and safe. Execute as Business-as-Usual — Two Transformation Paths Transformation happens within your daily operations, not outside them. Fractal integrates without disruption, enabling modernization as a continuous, invisible process. You can choose two complementary transformation paths, depending on your strategic intent and constraints: subtitle Path 1: Simplification & Replacement text_center italic "Fewer systems. Smarter architecture. Real innovation." We streamline your stack by replacing non-strategic applications with Custom SaaS built on Fractal. Each app is developed in a fraction of the time it would typically take to create them (as little as 5% of traditional effort) because we\'ve already solved the hard problems: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html Autonomous maintenance and updates. Advanced encryption and permissioning. Built-in business continuity and failover. Dynamic UI (web, chat, or hybrid). Federated cybersecurity and IP protection State-of-the-art AI models Aggregation of AI models from different providers Strategic apps are transitioned safely through orchestration with their live versions; non-strategic apps move directly to production under guided user supervision. Outcome: An ultra-lean, AI-native infrastructure — where complexity lives in the services layer, not the core. subtitle Path 2: AI Envelopment/Wrapper text_center italic "Keep your legacy. Make it intelligent." For organizations that must retain their existing stack, Fractal’s AI agents act as a federated layer of intelligence around legacy systems. They orchestrate data and usage flows across applications, making the environment adaptive and smart without changing the legacy. Over time, your legacy systems gain cognitive capabilities — they start to learn, synchronize, and operate autonomously — while you keep the full compliance and vendor stability of your original infrastructure. Outcome: A modernized architecture that behaves like a next-generation system — without replacing it.

AI has become the strategic differentiator for value creation — yet over 95% of AI initiatives fail to deliver measurable impact. Why? Because they are built on legacy architectures optimized for reporting, not reasoning. Fractal, SciTheWorld\'s AI-native enterprise platform, redefines transformation from the architectural layer up. It allows organizations to operate as intelligent systems, not collections of digital tools — achieving measurable gains in cost, speed, control, and innovation within weeks, not years. text_center text-white We don\'t stack technology. We craft intelligence. Why CEOs Need a New Architectural Model The Problem: Most enterprises apply AI as a “feature” on top of old systems — leading to siloed use cases, spiraling costs, and limited scalability. The Opportunity: By re-architecting operations around data, algorithms, and governance natively, CEOs can turn AI into a strategic production factor, not a project expense. Fractal enables this shift through three architectural principles: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html Federation: interconnect all departments under a common, AI-native language. Right to Play: redesign workflows and protocols to exploit new intelligence. Right to Win: secure competitive advantage through proprietary data, timing, and algorithms. Impact KPIs from deployments: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html -60% cost in IT and process maintenance 3x faster time-to-production for AI solutions +45% productivity in cross-department execution Zero latency governance: live compliance and audit trails built into workflows Fractal in Action: Enterprise Use Cases component components/base_components/base_list_component.html A.

Automation must scale, but security and compliance must remain absolute. Innovation must compound, not fragment. The organizations that will lead in this decade are those that achieve Extreme Efficiency — where AI, data, and operations work as one. Fractal, SciTheWorld’s AI-native enterprise platform, enables that. It delivers measurable efficiency gains by rebuilding operations at the architectural level, so companies can execute with speed, control, and adaptability simultaneously. text_center text-white Fractal turns AI from a set of tools into the core operating fabric of the company. The COO Challenge: Execution Without Friction The reality: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html 70% of transformations fail to reach scale. 85% of automation projects stall before cross-departmental impact. Operational visibility remains fragmented across most enterprises. These failures stem from legacy architecture — siloed data, duplicated processes, disconnected systems. AI initiatives are often layered onto this legacy, amplifying complexity instead of solving it. Fractal addresses the root cause. It replaces fragmentation with federated operations, unifying data, processes, and governance into a single AI-native system that learns, adapts, and optimizes continuously. Impact (based on deployments): component components/base_components/base_list_component.html +45% operational productivity –60% process cost 3× faster time-to-production for operational AI Real-time control with zero added complexity Fractal in Action: COO Use Cases component components/base_components/base_list_component.html A.

Cyber, climate, regulatory, and operational shocks now propagate in seconds, not quarters — while corporate risk functions remain fragmented, manual, and retrospective. The Chief Risk Officer must now lead a transformation: from reactive risk measurement to predictive risk orchestration — from protecting against events to engineering systemic resilience. Fractal, SciTheWorld’s AI-native enterprise platform, enables that shift. It connects financial, operational, cyber, and strategic risk under one federated architecture — turning risk management into a living, intelligent system. text_center text-white Fractal turns risk from defense into dynamic foresight. The CRO Challenge: Fragmented Data, Lagging Signals, and Systemic Exposure The Problem: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html 75% of risk reporting is still manual and backward-looking. 60% of organizations manage financial, cyber, and operational risk in silos. Early warning systems miss >50% of systemic interactions between risks. The Opportunity: Fractal creates a Federated Risk Intelligence Architecture that unifies all risk vectors through shared data maps, AI-based forecasting, and automated governance. This allows the CRO to move from mitigating exposure to managing anticipation. Measured Outcomes (based on deployments): component components/base_components/base_list_component.html +65% predictive accuracy in risk identification –70% reporting latency +45% capital efficiency –50% cost of control (audit, reporting, assurance) Fractal in Action: CRO Use Cases component components/base_components/base_list_component.html A.

[cite: 5] Reputation, perception, and internal alignment now evolve at machine speed, shaping valuation, trust, and even national influence. [cite: 6] The Chief Communications Officer stands at the nexus of this new competitive frontier. [cite: 7] But legacy communication tools — static dashboards, PR cycles, fragmented media monitoring — cannot manage real-time reputation ecosystems or coordinate cross-functional truth. [cite: 8] Fractal, SciTheWorld’s AI-native enterprise platform, enables the Cognitive Organization — one that perceives, interprets, and responds coherently across all narratives: financial, social, regulatory, and internal. [cite: 9] text_center text-white Fractal transforms communication from message management into cognitive command. [cite: 10] The CCO Challenge: Influence Without Illusion The Problem: [cite: 12] component components/base_components/base_list_component.html Reputational volatility has increased 5× in the last decade. [cite: 13] 70% of crises now emerge from internal data leaks or perception asymmetries. [cite: 14] Narrative latency — the time between event and response — still averages >48 hours in most corporations. [cite: 15] The Opportunity: Fractal provides a real-time communications architecture, where every signal — financial, operational, or social — feeds into a unified intelligence layer. [cite: 16] It allows the CCO to detect shifts in perception before they escalate, and to synchronize leadership messaging, investor narratives, and stakeholder confidence. [cite: 17] Measured Outcomes (based on deployments and case studies): [cite: 18] component components/base_components/base_list_component.html –80% response latency to emerging narratives [cite: 19] +60% message consistency across departments [cite: 20] +45% trust index gain (employee & investor alignment) [cite: 21] –50% crisis management cost [cite: 22] Fractal in Action: CCO Use Cases component components/base_components/base_list_component.html A. Cognitive Communications Intelligence [cite: 24] Use case: AI agents analyze millions of data points (news, social, internal memos, investor chatter) to detect sentiment shifts and emerging narratives.

Narrative Synchronization with the CFO [cite: 27] Use case: Coordination between CCO and CFO using Fractal’s shared intelligence loop — as described in “Advances in Cognitive Warfare.” [cite: 28] Financial data and public sentiment feed a joint dashboard. [cite: 29] CCO ensures external message alignment; CFO adjusts liquidity signaling accordingly. [cite: 30] AI agents detect divergence between perceived financial strength and real cash flow velocity. [cite: 31] Result: Real-time harmonization of narrative capital and financial capital. [cite: 32] Impact: The company communicates only truths that it can operationally sustain — neutralizing speculative volatility and amplifying trust. [cite: 32] (As shown in your paper, this coordination loop effectively prevents cognitive exploitation and manipulative market feedback — turning transparency into strategic defense.) [cite: 33] C.

Every company is generating unprecedented amounts of data — but most operate on architectures designed for storage, not intelligence. The result: rising cost, rising risk, and falling visibility. Fractal, SciTheWorld’s AI-native enterprise platform, gives CIOs the means to federate information, systems, and governance into a single, living architecture — so the enterprise can think and operate as one. text_center text-white Fractal turns information into intelligence, and governance into growth. The CIO Challenge: Coherence at Scale The Problem: component components/base_components/base_list_component.html 80% of enterprise data remains unused. System sprawl increases integration cost by 60–80%. Governance frameworks struggle to keep up with AI innovation. Information flows are siloed across ERP, CRM, HR, and analytics tools — each optimized locally, but disconnected globally. AI initiatives amplify, rather than solve, this fragmentation. The Opportunity: Fractal replaces legacy integration with federated intelligence — a system where data, AI, and processes communicate natively through Minimum Architecture Units (MAUs). Measured Outcomes (from live deployments): component components/base_components/base_list_component.html –65% integration cost +45% cross-departmental visibility 3× faster data-to-decision cycle 100% governance traceability Fractal in Action: CIO Use Cases component components/base_components/base_list_component.html A.
